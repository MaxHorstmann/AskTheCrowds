Exameno
=======

Crowdsource everyday decisions. Anonymously and in real-time.

Which sweater should I buy?
How much should I pay for this shirt?
What's a good name for this dog?

Ask an everyday question on Exameno and get immediate crowd response within minutes.

Why would I get good responses ouf of this? Because large, diverse crowds can outperforms individuals, even experts.
Read "The Wisdom of Crowds" by James Surowiecki to learn more.

Like: what's a good name for this dog?
A: John  B: Joe 
This is a multiple choice question.

Or: How much should I pay for this sweater?
From $10 to $200.
This is an estimation question.

Attach photos to your questions to get better answers.

Exameno is 100% anonymous, no sign-in is required and no personal data is recorded.
(Well, unless you add personal data to your question. Or a photo of a person. That's up to you.)

The fine print: use common sense. Don't make far-reaching life decisions based Exameno. If you're in 
serious trouble, seek professional help. Racist, pornographic, criminal or otherwise inappropriate content will not be tolerated on Exameno.
